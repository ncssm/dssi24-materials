    "Let's work with Galton's dataset again.  As a reminder, he looks at a family, and for each child, he measured the average height of the child's two parents, and the height of the child when they reach adulthood.  The former is called the \"midparent height\" in this notebook.  (Why average height of the two parents?  Well, he was thinking that if the dad was tall or the mom was tall, then their child might be more likely to be tall; and if they were both tall, then that might have an even stronger effect, so the height of both parents is relevant.)  We're going to investigate how well one could predict the future height of a couple's kid, based on the height of the two parents."

Let's work out how to do that.  The principle is to look for other couples who are similar (in terms of midparent height), where we know how tall their kid turned out to be, and use that to predict.  There might be multiple other couples that are similar, so we'll average the heights of all of their kids."
